Split view: writing on the left, drawing on the right

Projects can be a single page or a notebook, a notebook bein a collection of pages

Link views option: scrolling on one view will also scroll on the other, allows for example to have
a written narrative on the left and corresponding drawings on the right, scrolling through both at
the same time (drawings could be continuous like in webtoons)

Anchor points: anchor points can be assigned to a paragraph in the writing view,
placing one will also place an indicator on the scrollbar to see at which point it will be triggered.
An anchor point corresponds to a specific location, transition and zoom level on the draw space,
reaching it by scrolling down or placing the cursor in the paragraph will prompt the drawing view
to navigate to the corresponding location with the transition and zoom level associated.

Transitions: regular navigation, fade to black, unzoom - rezoom
Transitions should have customizable easing

3 drawing possibilities: pixel art, vectors, normal
You SHOULD be able to export pixel art and vectors at whatever resolution you wish
Mixing all 3 in a single draw space might be possible using "invisible" layers

Eraser has a normal mode and an "erase object" mode

Writing view should have IDE-like features, such as multiple cursors, numbered lines, indentation, etc.

Maybe add a "coding view" that allows you to draw by writing code?

Drawings can be added to groups and be in multiple layers to provide more options for organization

Variables files (which can be used in multiple projects, similarly to CSS files):
shortcut EX = "this is an example";
Now, writing "EX" will automatically write "this is an example"
